RapidMiner HypGraphs Extension
=============================

### Description

This extension implements the HypGraphs modeling and analysis approach proposed by Atzmueller et al. (2016).
It calculates the evidence score that a hypothesis transition matrix is similar to a given data matrix.
For interference calculation the HypTrails algorithm (Singer et al. 2015) is used, by the implementation of Florian Lemmerich (https://bitbucket.org/florian_lemmerich/hyptrails4j).
