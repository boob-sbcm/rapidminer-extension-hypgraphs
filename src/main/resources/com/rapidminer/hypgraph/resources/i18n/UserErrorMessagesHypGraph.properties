# This file is used to define Operator UserError messages which are displayed when the code in an
# Operator detects wrong parameter settings or otherwise encounters a problem.

#error.hypgraph.example_error.name  = This is an example error name.
#error.hypgraph.example_error.short = This is a short description of the error with a parameter {0}.
#error.hypgraph.example_error.long  = This is the long description of the error.

error.hypgraph.negativeValues.name = Negative matrix entris
error.hypgraph.negativeValues.short = The {0} matrix contains negative values. 
error.hypgraph.negativeValues.long =  The matrices for the HypeGraph algorithm should contain only non-negative values.

error.hypgraph.nonsymmetric.name = Wrong matrix dimensions
error.hypgraph.nonsymmetric.short = The input matrices are either not symmetric or of different dimensions
error.hypgraph.nonsymmetric.long =  The data and hypothesis matrices need to be symmetric and of the same size.
